About
--------

Tired of Powerpoint or Keynote.app?

This is a helper addon for making presentation slides using openFrameworks. With ofxSlides, making sequential draw calls becomes super simple, and still you can use ofMesh, ofVideoPlayer, ofxAssimpModelLoader, etc.


Usage
--------

See `example_simple`.
